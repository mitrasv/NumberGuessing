# NUS FinTech DevOps Course - CI/CD Show & Tell

For this task, I've modified a simple guess-the-number/higher-or-lower project that I found interesting on Github, from Aanchal1201/NumberGuessing . 

CI/CD pipeline

(to insert info once I come up with it)







Learnings:
1) Time management + Flask
I first tried to **code the entire programme from scratch**, which proved to be (obviously) very time-consuming, and not feasible to complete within a few days at my current skill level. Hence, I decided to piggyback off of others' code for the same programme, which showed me how unoriginal my idea was. I spent some time working on a forked version of cmlohr/flask_higher_lower, which used **Flask, a micro web framework** which should have allowed me to publish a static page directly from GitHub Pages or Netlify without need for a backend to be hosted. However, I could not get it to run on either despite troubleshooting, so I instead opted for a JS + HTML + CSS one I was more familiar with. 

2) Web hosting
I hosted my programme in both GitHub Pages and Netlify

3) CI/CD stuff, I guess
